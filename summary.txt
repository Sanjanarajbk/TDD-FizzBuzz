1.first write the test case before writing code -> TDD
2.test fails
3.write minimal logic to pass the test(It should not break the existing test)
AAA test format
4.test pass
5.refactor the code (naming conventions , extracting to methods)
6.refactoring should not break the existing functionality

Ping pong -> pairing method -> one test other code and vice-versa and continues
